# Dynamic Web Pages With JavaScript

Let’s say your name is Geppetto and you decided to create a puppet.  First, you would have to think about the size, shape, and what you would like your creation to become.  So you would start gathering wood in the right thickness for the different parts: head, torso, legs, and arms.  You would then whittle and cut each piece until it fit together.  This rough frame is HTML.

Next, you would flesh out the texture and features that make up the face, fingers, and toes.  As you paint in the colors of the skin, eyes, and hair, you begin to see your creation coming to life, but not quite… This is CSS.

Soon, a fairy comes along and sees all you’ve done.  With the wave of her wand, he becomes animated.  He’s alive!  He can now move and interact with you.  This is JavaScript.  

So what the fairy did for Geppetto, JavaScript can do for HTML and CSS.  It can not only bring your website to life, it can calculate, manipulate, and validate data.

- Input - The information the computer takes in

- Processing - Interpreting that information
- Output - Communicating the results to the users

> Computers are made up of many, many circuits that perform different calculations.  It’s amazing that we get the most complex programs, images and functions from just a simple switch that turns off and on. Binary code is the most basic form of software and it controls all the hardware of the computer. **- Jerome Holman**

> Inside every computer is an operating system managing software that controls the computer’s hardware.  The software is a series of commands made of simple binary code. That binary code is just electrical signals flowing through billions of tiny circuits. **- Erica Gomez**
